sudo cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.1 /opt/freeswitchlibs/
sudo cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.1 /opt/freeswitchlibs/
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4 /opt/freeswitchlibs

# Modify FreeSWITCH service to use these specific libraries:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/freeswitch.service.d/override.conf

# Add this line in the [Service] section:
# please take note only the below line should be included in the file to prevent more errors
# take of how the Environment=<path>=<path of your custome folder>

Environment="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/freeswitchlibs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
